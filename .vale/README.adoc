= .vale for Antora site

This repository provides the .vale directory for running https://vale.sh[Vale] on the content of an Antora site.

== Usage

Run the following at the root of your playbook project.

 $ git clone https://gitlab.com/opendevise/oss/antora-dot-vale .vale

You can then run Antora with the Vale integration enabled.

 $ npx -y --package antora --package @antora/collector-extension antora \
   --extension .lib/antora-vale-integration-extension.js antora-playbook.yml

The Vale output will be written to vale.rdjsonl or vale.log, depending on whether or not the content is local to the playbook repository and branch.

The Vale integration extension can be run on an author playbook in the worktree for an individual content source instead of on the whole site.

See the https://docs.antora.org/collector-extension/latest/use-cases/#vale-integration[Vale integration] docs for more information.
